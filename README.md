# minix-ai-scheduler
Exploring the intersection of Tanenbaum’s MINIX 3 and low-level AI. This repo contains a custom MINIX kernel that exports telemetry to a hand-coded Python NN to predict CPU burst times. Aiming to build a closed-ecosystem system controller for RISC-V hardware, similar to the Intel Management Engine. Long-term research for post-grad specialization.
